# Bayesian Modeling

The R world has generally done a better job thaan the python world at documenting hierarichal
models. Some simple examples, like David Robinson's baseball series can be  implemented pretty
easily, but even there some of the more advanced models are far more difficult in Python.

My examples are found from NumPyro, and largely around the Statistical Rethinking series of talks.
Those examples were also given in R, but there have been several translations to NumPyro.
